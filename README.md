# tmux-web-monitor

**English** | [한국어](README.ko.md)

A web service for viewing and attaching to the tmux sessions running on your PC from a browser.
It was built for keeping several Claude Code sessions in tmux and checking on them or working in them from a PC or a phone.

The UI is in Korean.

## Features

- **Session list**: last 3 lines of output and a status per session (shell, running, Claude working / needs input / idle), sorting, groups
- **Terminal**: attaches to tmux sessions with xterm.js; reconnects automatically when the connection drops
- **Split view**: drag a tab to split up/down/left/right, a tab bar per area, resize with the dividers
- **Session management**: create (working folder, start command), rename, kill; switch and close tmux windows/panes
- **Input**: input box for Korean (IME) text, buttons for frequently used commands, mobile keys (Esc, Ctrl, arrows, …)
- **Files**: browse under the home folder, view Markdown and code, upload files. Editing, copy, move and delete are optional (off by default)
- **Copy**: selecting text by dragging in the terminal or file viewer copies it to the clipboard of the device you are using
- **Notifications**: web push when a Claude task finishes or needs input (requires HTTPS)
- **Save/restore sessions**: the tmux-persist add-on saves periodically and restores after a reboot

Claude status is detected from text on the screen (`esc to interrupt`, `Do you want to…`, etc.).
If Claude Code changes its screen layout, the status may be wrong.

## Requirements

- Linux (used on Ubuntu/Debian) or macOS
- tmux 3.x, Python 3.10 or later
- nginx, if you use the HTTPS install mode

The macOS install script has been written but not tested on a real Mac.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jyhan-89/tmux-web-monitor.git
cd tmux-web-monitor
install/ubuntu.sh          # macOS: install/macos.sh
```

The install script sets up packages, a Python virtual environment, a login account and auto-start
(systemd user service / launchd). It is safe to run again.

| Mode | Option | URL |
|---|---|---|
| Same network (default) | none | `http://<IP>:8765/dev` |
| HTTPS (nginx + self-signed certificate) | `--https` | `https://<IP>/dev` |
| This PC only | `--local` | `http://localhost:8765/dev` |

Other options

- `--with-persist`: also install the tmux-persist add-on (see below)
- `--no-service`: do not register auto-start (run `./run.sh` yourself)
- `-y`: answer yes to all questions (except creating the account)
- Change the port: `PORT=9000 install/ubuntu.sh`

The default mode is plain HTTP, so browsers show "Not secure", and web push, the paste button and
installing as a home-screen app are not available.
If you need them, install with `--https` or use Tailscale Serve (below).

### Certificates in HTTPS mode

`--https` creates a CA for this PC and issues a certificate for its IP addresses with that CA.
To remove the browser warning, download `http://<IP>/dev/ca.crt` on each device once and install it as a trusted root certificate.
If the IP changes, run the install script again; only the server certificate is reissued (the CA stays the same).

## Account

The install script asks you to create an account. To create it later or reset a forgotten password,
open `http://localhost:8765/dev/setup` **in a browser on the server PC**.

- Account and server settings (such as allowing file edits) can only be changed when connecting from the server PC via localhost
- Changing the password logs out every device
- From the command line: `.venv/bin/python auth.py [username]`

## Usage

| To do | How |
|---|---|
| Open a session | Click it in the list. It opens as a tab in the selected area |
| Split the view | Drag a tab or a session from the list to an edge of the terminal area |
| Session / group menu | Right-click in the list (phone: 📁 ✎ ✕ buttons) |
| Type Korean | Type in the input box at the bottom, then Enter |
| See earlier output | Mouse wheel / swipe up or down on a phone |
| Copy | Select by dragging (inside Claude's screen, Shift+drag or the setting below) |
| Browse files | 📂 at the top. Copy/move/delete via the right-click menu (when edits are allowed) |
| Save/restore | 💾 above the session list |

### Copying from the Claude Code screen

In apps that use the mouse, such as Claude Code, dragging is sent to the app.
To receive what the app copies on your device's clipboard, let tmux pass the clipboard sequence (OSC 52) through.
tmux's default (`external`) ignores it.

```bash
tmux set -s set-clipboard on
echo 'set -s set-clipboard on' >> ~/.tmux.conf
```

### Save/restore sessions (tmux-persist)

`addons/tmux-persist/` is a script that saves tmux sessions and recreates them.
It saves window/pane layout, working folders and screen contents, and reopens a running Claude Code with
`claude --resume <conversation ID>`.

- With `--with-persist`, it saves every 5 minutes and restores at login (boot)
- From 💾 in the web UI you can save now or restore any snapshot. Existing sessions are skipped
- Command line: `tmux-persist save | restore [snapshot] | list`

## Remote access

This service gives a shell in the browser. **Do not expose it directly to the internet** (e.g. by port forwarding).
Use a VPN when you are away.

With [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up
tailscale ip -4                       # connect to this IP
```

With Tailscale Serve, the `*.ts.net` address gets a publicly trusted certificate, so no CA has to be installed on each device.
(Enable MagicDNS and HTTPS Certificates in the admin console first. It conflicts with the `--https` mode on port 443.)

```bash
sudo tailscale serve --bg http://127.0.0.1:8765     # https://<machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net/dev
```

## Configuration

| Environment variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Address to listen on (`0.0.0.0` in the same-network mode) |
| `PORT` | `8765` | Port |
| `BASE_PATH` | `/dev` | URL path |
| `TMUX_WEB_FILES_ROOT` | `~` | Root of the file browser |
| `TMUX_WEB_CONFIG` | `~/.config/tmux-web` | Settings and data folder |
| `TMUX_WEB_AUTH` | `~/.config/tmux-web/auth.json` | Account file |
| `TMUX_WEB_TLS` | `~/.config/tmux-web/tls` | Self-signed certificate folder |
| `TMUX_PERSIST_DIR` | `~/.local/share/tmux-persist` | Snapshot folder |

`~/.config/tmux-web/` holds the account, login sessions, command buttons and groups, web push keys and
subscriptions, and certificates. It is not part of the repository.

## Administration

```bash
systemctl --user status tmux-web        # status (macOS: launchctl list kr.tmuxweb.server)
systemctl --user restart tmux-web       # restart
journalctl --user -u tmux-web -n 50     # logs (macOS: ~/Library/Logs/tmux-web.log)
```

To update, `git pull` and run the install script again with the same options.
Open browser tabs show a "new version available" notice.

Uninstall (Ubuntu)

```bash
systemctl --user disable --now tmux-web && rm ~/.config/systemd/user/tmux-web.service
sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/tmux-web && sudo systemctl reload nginx   # if installed with --https
addons/tmux-persist/uninstall.sh                                            # if installed with --with-persist
rm -rf ~/.config/tmux-web                                                   # also remove account and settings
```

## Security

- Anyone who logs in can use a shell with the PC user's permissions. Use it only on networks you trust
- Passwords are stored as scrypt hashes; 5 failed attempts within 5 minutes block that IP for 5 minutes
- The file browser rejects paths outside `TMUX_WEB_FILES_ROOT` (including via symlinks), and editing is off by default
- In the default mode (HTTP), passwords and terminal contents are not encrypted
